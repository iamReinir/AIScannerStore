**The Student’s Guide of Capstone Project Document for the FPT University Students**  
\--- \* \---

# **I. General Introduction**

## ***1\. Capstone Project’s description***

Develop of a significantly complex software system, employing knowledge gained from courses throughout the program including defining requirements, design, implementation, and quality assurance. Students must follow a suitable process model, pay attention to quality issues, and manage the project themselves, following all appropriate project management techniques. Success of the project has to deliver the stages on times. 

*Sample deliverables:*  
Students should deliver one or several iterations of a software system, along with all artifacts appropriate to the process model they are using. These would likely include a project plan (perhaps updated regularly and containing cost estimations, risk analysis, division of the work into tasks, etc.), requirements (including use cases), architectural and design documents, test plans, source code, and an installable software package.

*Additional teaching considerations:*

* It is anticipated that this course will not have formal lectures, although students are expected to attend progress presentations by other groups.  
* It is suggested that students be required to have a ‘customer’ for whom they are developing their software. This could be a company, a professor, or several people selected as representing people in the potential market. The objective of the project would be to solve the customer’s problem, and the customer would therefore assist the instructor in evaluating the work.  
* It is strongly suggested that students work in groups of at least three, and preferably four or five, on their capstone project. Strategies must be developed to handle situations where the contribution of team members is unequal.

## ***2\. The IT Capstone Project Products***

The Capstone Project Product is composed of 7 parts:

* Part 1: Project Introduction  
* Part 2: Project Management Plan (PMP)  
* Part 3: Software Requirements Specifications (SRS)  
* Part 4: Software Design Description (SDD)  
* Part 5: Software Test Documentation (STD)

## ***2\. Templates for Tracking Project Status & Progress***

### **2.1 Project Schedule & Tasks**

To track the project schedule/time, the team need to prepare and track the project schedule (broke into main task level) using the Microsoft Project or Project Libre tool.   
Sample schedule can be found in the provided sample schedule \- **Report2\_Sample Project Schedule** as mentioned above.  
Detailed tasks can be tracked using any team-convenient tools (GitLab, Trello, Asana, etc.)

### **2.2 Tracking Project Information**

The Project team should maintain a tracking database which includes below information:

* WBS: for tracking project works  
* Issues: for tracking the project issues   
* Defects: for tracking the product defects  
* Q\&A: to track the questions & answers during project progress

The details of each sheet can be found in the template file ***Report3\_Project Tracking***. 

The team can convert those files to Google sheet and share among the team and the supervisor so that all people can access, track information and have real-time information.

You can also track that information using any team-convenient tools (GitLab, Trello, Asana, etc.)
